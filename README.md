## Overview

This project, maintained by [sagexd08](https://github.com/sagexd08), is a Python-based chatbot that uses a combination of memory management, emotion detection, and a personality engine to simulate a natural conversation. By utilizing the Gemini model from [google-generativeai](https://github.com/google/generative-ai), the chatbot can generate thoughtful, contextually aware responses. It is designed to be easily extended and integrated into various applications.

---

## Features

- **Context Management:**  
  Uses a custom memory manager to store recent interactions, track common topics, and provide relevant conversation context. This helps maintain a continuous and meaningful dialogue.

- **Emotion Detection:**  
  Implements an emotion detection system that analyzes user inputs to determine emotions such as happy, sad, angry, curious, or grateful. The chatbot adjusts its responses based on these emotional cues.

- **Personality Engine:**  
  Enhances responses with appropriate emojis and a friendly tone. This engine adds a layer of personalization that makes interactions feel more human-like and engaging.

- **Gemini Generative AI Integration:**  
  Connects to Google's Gemini model through the `google-generativeai` package to generate natural, fluent responses. This integration allows the chatbot to handle a wide range of conversation topics effectively.

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  Sanitizes user inputs to remove problematic characters, ensuring safe and clean processing of the conversation.

- **Logging:**  
  Utilizes Python's `logging` module to record interactions and errors, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.

*Note: The file names and structure assume the main code is contained in `chatbot.py`.*

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagexd08/friendly-chatbot.git
cd friendly-chatbot
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file containing:

```txt
google-generativeai
textblob
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Standard libraries (e.g., `datetime`, `json`, `logging`, etc.) are included with Python.*

---

## Usage

### 1. Configure Your API Key

Before running the chatbot, update the `API_KEY` variable in `chatbot.py` with your actual Google API key:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Run the Chatbot

Launch the chatbot by running:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

You should see a welcome message similar to:

```
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm your friendly AI companion! How can I help you today?
```

### 3. Interact with the Chatbot

Type your messages in the terminal. To exit, simply type `bye`, `goodbye`, `exit`, or `quit`.

---

## Configuration

- **Memory Manager:**  
  The chatbot stores a short-term conversation history (default up to 15 messages) and tracks topics using simple keyword matching. This allows the bot to refer back to earlier parts of the conversation.

- **Emotion Detection & Personality Engine:**  
  The `EmotionDetector` class scans user input for emotional keywords. The `PersonalityEngine` then adapts the response by appending suitable emojis and adjusting the tone to fit the detected emotion.

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  User input is sanitized using regular expressions to remove any potentially problematic characters before processing.

- **Logging:**  
  All significant actions and errors are logged to `chatbot.log` using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module, making troubleshooting easier.
